		<p id="headpara">I'm going to be honest, I only really started cooking/baking a few years ago. This recipe is not my own recipe but one I found on <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2015/07/very-blueberry-scones/" target="_blank">Smitten Kitchen</a>, one of my favourite recipe sites. All images, recipe directions and ingredients were taken from her site. I am merely using her content for my <a href="http://www.lighthouselabs.ca/prep/1-html-and-css.html" target="_blank">HTML/CSS prep class</a> at <a href="http://www.lighthouselabs.ca/" target="_blank">Lighthouse Labs.</a> I'm very excited for my prep class and taking the full time <em>Web Development</em> program offered at Lighthouse Labs.</p>

		<h3>Directions - Toggle to expand</h3>
			<ol id="accordion">
				<li><h4 class="accordion-toggle">Preheat your oven</h4>
				<p class="accordion-content default">Heat oven to 400&deg;F (205&deg;C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</p></li>
	
				<li><h4 class="accordion-toggle">Mix it up</h4>
				<p class="accordion-content">In a large bowl, combine flours, zest, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add cold butter and work into the flour mixture <em>until the biggest pieces are the size of small peas with either your fingertips or a pastry blender</em>. Stir in blueberries, then milk, mixing only until large clumps form. Use your hands to reach inside the bowl and <em>gently</em> knead the mixture into one mass. The more you knead, the wetter the dough will get as the blueberries break up, so work quickly and knead only a few times.<br></br>

				<li><h4 class="accordion-toggle">Cut it out</h4>
				<p class="accordion-content">Transfer dough to a well-floured counter and pat into a roughly 1-inch tall disc. Cut into 8 to 10 wedges, do not fret if the blueberries are now making a mess of the dough; it will all work out in the oven. Transfer wedges to prepared baking sheet, spacing them apart. Brush the tops of each with egg, then sprinkle with coarse sugar.<br></br>

				<li><h4 class="accordion-toggle">Bake it baby</h4>
				<p class="accordion-content">Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until scones are golden brown on top. Serve warm. I find most scones to be best the first day, but these were not bad at all on day two, gently rewarmed in the oven before eating.<br></br>

				<li><h4 class="accordion-toggle">Freezing instructions</h4>
				<p class="accordion-content"> I like to freeze scones unbaked and usually hold any egg wash until I'm ready to bake them. Simply spread the wedges on a baking sheet and chill until frozen solid and will no longer stick to each other, and pack tightly into a freezer bag. You can bake them right from the freezer; you'll only need 2 to 4 minutes extra baking time.</p></li>
